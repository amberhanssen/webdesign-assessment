      <h2>About me!</h2>
      <p>G'day!ðŸ’œ
        My name is Amber! Welcome to my website! </p

      <p>
        Firstly I would like to thank you for stopping by, I really appreciate it even if you're only here briefly. A little bit about myself, 
        I'm first and formost a cosplayer and Mixer streamer! ðŸ’œ</p>
    
        <p>Ever since the start of high school, creating content online is something I have been passionate about. 
          When I was 14, I had a book series on Wattpad that I loved writing and engaging with its audience. 
          When that began growing and becoming more elaborate, I concluded being a content creator is something I want to do. 
          I began cosplaying in 2013, around the same time I was writing. Cosplay became a safe place for me through my high school experience, 
          a getaway. I hope you, the reader will be able to use my website, my streams and in general my content to hopefully make your day that
        little bit better cause I know that'll make my day too! </p>

      </p>
      <p> Please feel free to look around my website and thank you so much again for your support! </p>
